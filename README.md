A simple number guessing game made with Python. 

Checklist:
- Allow a number between 1 and 100 to be guessed.
- Allow the user to pick between an 'easy' and 'hard' mode.
- Easy mode gives the user 10 attempts to guess. Hard mode gives the user 5 attempts to guess.
- If the user guesses the correct number, end the game.
- If the user guesses incorrectly, inform them their number was too high or too low. 
- Check if the user runs out of guesses. If they do, end the game.
